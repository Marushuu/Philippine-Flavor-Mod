  phfp_je_conquest_of_moroland_reason: "The Muslim Sultanates of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago have maintained their independence for centuries, successfully resisting Spanish colonial control through fierce resistance and strategic diplomacy. These territories contain valuable resources and strategic ports, but integrating them into our new republic will require military conquest and careful administration of diverse populations with distinct religious and cultural traditions.\n\n#italic 'The Moros have never been conquered by Spain in 300 years of colonization. They are a proud warrior people who fight not for political reasons, but for their faith and their ancestral lands. The question before us is whether we shall succeed where the Spanish failed, or find another path to unity'#!"
